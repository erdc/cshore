# cshore

The numerical model CSHORE predicts beach evolution over the nearshore
region, and a full description of the model development is available
in Kobayashi et al. 2009. The combined wave and current model operates
under the assumption of longshore uniformity and includes the effects
of a wave roller and quadratic bottom shear stress.  The numerical
integration of the depth-averaged energy, momentum, and continuity
equations results in predictions of wave height, water level, and
wave-induced steady current. The development of new and physically
defensible sediment transport algorithms for a nearshore breaking wave
environment has been the focus of the most recent research efforts.
The model accounts for wave and current interaction, bedload,
suspended load, and wave-related sediment transport. The interested
reader is referred to Kobayashi et al. 2009 for a detailed description
of the model formulation of these processes.
