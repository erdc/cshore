When there is revetment, in.perm = 1. In CSHORE source code (in the part where reads in NBINP and NPINP), CSHORE will always read in both NBINP and NPINP.

However, if we incorporate the lines in makeinfile_usace.m: 
if in.iperm==1|in.isedav>=1
  fprintf(fid,'%-8i                             ->NPINP \n',length(in.x_p));
end
to makeinfile_usace_vegfeature.m, these line make troubles. 
In the case that there is no revetment and there is only vegetation, if we set in.perm = 0 but still keep in.iprofl=0, the makeinfile code cannot read in in.sedav values (although we set in.isedav = 1). By default, in.isedav = 0, and in this case, CSHORE will not read in NPINP and code report errors. 

I also tested that if we let in.perm=1, in.isedav=1, the runup will be further reduced. 
If we let in.iprofl = 1, the results are NAN.
